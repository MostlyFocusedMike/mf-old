# Mostly Focused
## A site that will be completely focused on anything. 

#### Project Goals
* Create perfectly scaling, responsive viewfinder that features css animations
* Incorporate AJAX and Local Storage 
* Built without any frameworks or libraries to increase speed

#### Project Notes
This site will be a sort of tutorial site that incorporates helpful visuals that seek to explain the WHY before the HOW. Early topics will most likely be all over the place and the learning paths will only feature one or two lessons each. If this ever becomes more than just a portfolio piece/blue print, I would love to collaborate with people in all kinds of fields to create more lessons. But, we'll see.
